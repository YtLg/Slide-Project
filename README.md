# Slide-Project

This is my first unity game attempt after learning unity basics.


## The Idea

The idea of this game is that you click on the screen to shoot a shotgun that can kill enemies, this shotgun, however is also your only way of moving,
the knockback of your shotgun sends you in the opposite direction of where you shoot and there will be limited ammo (but you can pick up more), that you
have to manage to shoot and move at the same time.

I'm also interested in implementing this same idea into a platformer setting, where instead of trying to survive as long as you can, you need to clear obstacles and levels using this movement mechanic.
